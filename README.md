# Vehicle Tracker App

A vehicle tracking web application that displays the vehicle's current location and dynamically rotates the vehicle icon as it moves along the route. The application uses Leaflet for the map rendering and React for the frontend. The app tracks the movement of a vehicle in real-time, showing the route on a map and updating the vehicle's position along the way.

## Features

- Displays vehicle's real-time location on the map.
- Vehicle rotates according to the direction of movement.
- Displays vehicle information such as name and petrol level on hover.
- Tracks the route with a dynamic path that updates as the vehicle moves.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Map Rendering**: Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Node.js 
- **Styling**: Plain CSS

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitusergb/vehicleTracker.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd vehicleTracker
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Live Demo

Assignment for Full-Stack Developer: Vehicle Movement on a Map

Objective:
Create a web application that displays a vehicle moving on a map using either Google Maps or an alternative mapping library. The application should show the vehicle's current location and its path in real-time.

Expectations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0r0IMQvC1No

Requirements:
Frontend:
Use Google Maps or an alternative mapping library (e.g., Leaflet).
Display a vehicle icon on the map.
Show the vehicle's movement in real-time, updating every few seconds.
Draw the route the vehicle is taking on the map.
Backend:
Provide an API endpoint that supplies the vehicle's current location and route data.
Implement a simple server using Node.js/Express, Django, or another backend framework.

Dummy Data:
Create a JSON file with dummy location data (latitude and longitude) that simulates the vehicle's movement along a route.
Example of dummy data format:
json
[
  {"latitude": 17.385044, "longitude": 78.486671, "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:00:00Z"},
  {"latitude": 17.385045, "longitude": 78.486672, "timestamp": "2024-07-20T10:00:05Z"},
  ...
]
Resources
To create the route and latitude longitude you can use below links.
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility
https://valhalla.github.io/demos/polyline/
To show the directions you can use google maps directions api or ola maps/mapbox api


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
